# Hello! Thank you for landing here.

This is my portfolio site, where I host my work.

-- **UNDER CONSTRUCTION** --

This portfolio is still under construction, and most likely will be for quite a while.

**My links in the top-right of the page work though.** Be sure to go to my github repos and have a look through my **python stuff** and my **java stuff**. All my favourite source code is hosted in those repos.

## My name is Neil Fink, I'm a software development student.
I also consider myself a hobbyist game designer, and I am working towards a stronger skillset every day of the week.
I have quite a few games and lots of example code. Down below, I'll feature some of my all-time favourite snippets of code that I've written.
