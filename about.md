## About

I am a 23-year-old software development student currently enrolled at Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario.

I have a solid background in hobbyist game design and coding. I've experimented with many languages and have a strong sense of OOP design, mainly with Java / Javascript-style syntax.
Below are the languages I have experience with:
- GML (Game Maker Language), 10 years
- Java, 2 years
- Python, 1 year
- HTML / CSS, 1 year
- PHP, under 1 year
- C#, under 1 year
- C++, under 1 year

Since the age of 11 I've had a major interest in building software, mainly games. I convinced my parents to get me a licenced copy of GameMaker 8 for my laptop, which I then went on to spend countless hours every day making games. Over time, my games started looking better, performing better, and involving more parts of the built-in scripting language called GML (which stands for Game Maker Language). GML is like a cross between Java and Javascript, and it handles functions made specifically for manipulating game objects in the GameMaker IDE. As my skills in GameMaker got better, I became more interested in languages that businesses actually use.

I took computer software and hardware classes all through high school, where I was introduced to Python, Java, Turing and C. It was great learning about techniques which I had never known of before, like functional programming, OOP, typecasting and security keywords. There were many other concepts introduced in those classes, but I don't want to keep listing things off and carrying on.

Fast-forward to today, where I'm ready to take my skills into a real workplace. After some searching for a few years after high school, I needed to come back to software development and take it seriously. That's what drove me to enroll in Software Development (559) at Mohawk College in my hometown, Hamilton. I've gained valuable skills and have built projects which I believe showcase both my creativity and ability to create unique solutions to problems. Both on my main page and projects page, I've showcased many of my pieces of software which I've made over the past few years.
